    "**How to Use the Template (Quick Steps):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **New Jupyter Notebook:** Create a new Python 3 notebook in Jupyter.\n",
    "2.  **Rename:** Immediately rename it (e.g., `Python_Ch1_Intro_[Date].ipynb`).\n",
    "3.  **Markdown Cell:** Add a cell at the top and change its type to \"Markdown.\"\n",
    "4.  **Paste Template:** Paste the Markdown code above into the cell.\n",
    "5.  **Fill It In:**  Edit the template, replacing the bracketed placeholders with your actual notes in each section as you learn.\n",
    "6.  **Code Cells:** Add code cells for Python code examples below the \"Code Examples\" section.\n",
    "7.  **Format:** Use Markdown formatting (headings, lists, bold, etc.) for clear notes. Use LaTeX in Markdown for math if needed.\n",
    "8.  **Save & Commit:** Save your notebook regularly and commit it to Git after each study session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** This template is your *consistent structure* for daily notes in Jupyter.  Use it for every new topic you learn to keep your learning organized, active, and review-ready!"
