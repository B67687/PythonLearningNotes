    "# Git Commit Message - 3/1/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Key Concepts:\n",
    "* **Type Prefixes:** Start commits with terms like 'feat:', 'fix:', 'docs:' to categorize change type\n",
    "* **Concise Subject:** For most commits, keep the subject line brief and to the point\n",
    "* **Descriptive Body (Essential for Important Changes)** For significant commits, explain *how* and *why* the change was made in detail. Focus on reasoning, context, and thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Examples & Scenarios:\n",
    "**Good Commit Message Example 1 (Feature):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "feat: Add user authentication with OAuth 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Implements user authentication using OAuth 2.0 flow.\n",
    "* Integrates with Google OAuth provider.\n",
    "* Stores user authentication tokens securely in session storage.\n",
    "* Adds new middleware to protect API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhances security and allows users to log in with their existing Google accounts, improving user experience.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Good Commit Message Example 2 (Bug Fix):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "fix: Correctly handle edge case in discount calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixes a bug where discount was not applied correctly when both percentage and fixed amount discounts were active\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue occurred when both discount types were enabeld simultaneously. The code was incorrectly applying the percentage discount after subtracting the fixed amount, leading to an incorrect final price.\n",
    "\n",
    "This commit corrects the discount calculation logic to apply the percentage discount to original price before subtracting the fixed amount, ensuring accurate discounts in all scenarios\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Commit Message Example 3 (Documentation Update):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "* docs: Update README with setup instructions for local development\n",
    "\n",
    "Adds a detailed \"Local Development Setup\" section to the README.md file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section now includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step-by-step instructions for installing dependencies (Node.js, npm, Python).\n",
    "* Guidance on setting up virtual environments (Python).\n",
    "* Instructions for configuring environment variables.\n",
    "* Troubleshooting tips for common setup issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This improved documentation will make it easier for new developers to set up the project locally and contribute.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Less-Good Commit Message & Why (Improved Example):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "update: minor changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed some typos and improved wording in a few places.\n",
    "Refactored some code for readability.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why Less Good**: While slightly better than \"update: code changes,\" this is still too vague. \"Minor changes,\" \"typos,\" \"wording,\" \"readability\" - these are all very general.  A better message would specify what was changed (files, code areas, specific typos) and why those changes were made. It lacks specific details and context, making it harder to understand the actual impact of the commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Notes & Insights & Reflections:\n",
    "* Before today, I had opted for writing conversational yet concise commit messages such as ```Added Template_Notebook.ipynb```. I do value commit messages as a way for me to keep track of the specifics of what I have done and where I have done it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But I have come to learn more effective communication by separating different assets of the message into: nature of change, concise title of what changed, descriptive message of why and how it changed. These are known as type prefixes, title, and description. However, I am still thinking about what 'descriptive' really means in practice. It's not just about writing *longer* messages for sure, but about including specific and relevant details. For exmaple, whe writing a body, I need to focus on explaining on why the change was needed and perhaps the thought process that I went though to get to this change. What were the thought processes? Perhaps - what problem was I solving? What approach did I take? Were there any trade-offs? I need to practice being more explicit about my reasoning and the context behind the code changes, not just the changes themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "* I noticed that this approach eases the cognitive load of developers that are not just myself who are reading commit messages and understanding them. In team efforts, this streamlines work between different developers through improving the efficiency and accuracy of communication. For me personally, moving forward, I need to make a conscious effort to write these detailed messages for every commit. It is easy to understand theory, but I need to make it a habit. I think everytime I want to commit instantly, I should pause. Using ```git commit``` without the ```-m``` will make this pause a lot more perceptible. Pause and reason through the whys of what changed, your thought process, which is what was lacking or what was needed, and then what the change is intended to improve on\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Further Research:\n",
    "*   **Footers in Commit Messages:** Investigate use cases and conventions for *footers* in commit messages. Specifically, when are 'Fixes:', 'Refs:', 'BREAKING CHANGE:' footers used and how are they formatted?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Type Prefix Usage in Open Source Projects:** Research commit history of a popular open-source Python project (e.g., Django, Requests, Pandas). Analyze how they use type prefixes in their commit messages. Are there any prefixes they use consistently that are not in the 'conventional commits' standard? Why might they use those?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Automated Commit Message Tools:** Explore automated tools and linters that can *help enforce* commit message standards. Are there tools that check for type prefixes, subject line length, blank lines, or suggest improvements?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Resources for Deeper Understanding:**  Find and read 2-3 articles or blog posts about best practices for Git commit messages from reputable software engineering sources (e.g., articles from GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, thought leaders in DevOps/Agile).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Active Recall Practice:\n",
    "*   **Question 1: Structure of a Conventional Commit Message:** Describe the three main parts of a standard Conventional Commit message. What is the purpose of each part? Why is the blank line between the subject and body important?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Question 2: Type Prefixes - Categories of Changes:** List at least 5 common type prefixes used in Conventional Commits. For each prefix, give a brief example of the *type of change* that would be associated with it (e.g., `feat: ...` - adding a new user-facing feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Question 3: Imperative Mood in Subject Lines:** Explain why commit message subject lines should be written in the imperative mood (e.g., \"Add feature,\" not \"Added feature\"). Give an example of a subject line written in imperative mood and one written in non-imperative mood, and explain which is better and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Question 4: When to Use a Body:** When is it *essential* to include a body in a commit message, and when might a subject line alone be sufficient?  Give 2-3 examples of situations where a body would be strongly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Question 5: Scenario - Bug Fix Commit:** Imagine you just fixed a bug where users couldn't submit a form on your website in a specific browser. Write a *good* commit message (subject line and body) for this bug fix, using Conventional Commits style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Spaced Repetition Review Schedule:\n",
    "✅ **Initial Review (right after creating these notes):** [Date of creation - TODAY - Done!] - Briefly reread the entire notebook to solidify initial learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ **Review 1 (Next Day):** [Tomorrow's Date - 4/1/2025] - Review Key Concepts, Reflections, and try to answer Active Recall Questions from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ **Review 2 (3 Days Later):** [Date + 3 days - 7/1/2025] - Focus on Active Recall Questions. Review Key Concepts section if needed for questions you struggled with.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ **Review 3 (1 Week Later):** [Date + 1 week - 10/1/2025] -  Review Reflections and Active Recall Questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ **Review 4 (2 Weeks Later):** [Date + 2 weeks - 24/1/2025] - Review Reflections and Active Recall Questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ **Monthly Reviews (Ongoing):**  Schedule a brief monthly review (e.g., at the start of each month) to revisit these notes and keep the principles fresh in your mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Tool for Tracking Reviews - Optional, but helpful):**  I will use [Google Calendar] to schedule and track these review dates."
